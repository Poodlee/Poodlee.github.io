# Baedari: Round Trip RC Car

Baedari is a **low-cost RC car project** designed for autonomous round-trip navigation, inspired by **desert ants' path integration**. Developed as a graduation project from July to December 2023, it leverages **IR sensors** and **2D LiDAR** for obstacle detection, route planning, and returning to its starting point.

| Path Type | Color | Observations |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Ground Truth** | Yellow | Actual route taken |
| **LiDAR Localization** | Green | More accurate but slow updates |
| **Path Integration** | Blue | Low-cost, but drift accumulates |

‚úÖ **Path shape is maintained**, but **errors accumulate over time**. 

## üîç Why Does This Discrepancy Occur?
The **path integration method** works as expected, maintaining a general trajectory close to ground truth. However, deviations in localization primarily stem from the **absence of map-based position corrections**. To improve accuracy, incorporating additional **reference points** (e.g., landmarks or feature-based localization) could be beneficial.

### **Localization Challenges**
- **No Map-Based Position Correction** ‚Üí The system cannot compare its location to a predefined map, leading to cumulative errors.
- **Motor Signal-Based Path Integration** ‚Üí Small odometry errors accumulate over time but do not significantly affect overall navigation.
- **LiDAR Localization Lag** ‚Üí The update rate is too low for real-time corrections in fast movement scenarios.

## üîß System Features

### **Sensor Comparison**
| Sensor Type | Maximum Distance | Frequency | Field of View |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Infrared Sensors** | ~1.5m | 24‚Äì25Hz | Narrow |
| **LiDAR** | ~12m | 5‚Äì7Hz | 360¬∞ |

- **Infrared sensors** provide quick response times for close-range obstacle detection.
- **LiDAR sensors** offer broader field coverage and long-range detection, enhancing global navigation awareness.

### **Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms**

| Algorithm | Sensor | Goal-Oriented? | Smoothness | Avg. Speed | Computational Load |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|------------|------------------|
| **WVAD** | IR | No | High | 2.8 m/s | High |
| **SBAD** | IR | No | High | 2.4 m/s | Low |
| **OFSD** ‚úÖ | LiDAR | Yes | Medium | 1.1‚Äì1.4 m/s | Medium |

### **Detailed Algorithm Descriptions**
- **WVAD (Wall Detection Autonomous Driving)**: Uses IR sensors to create a virtual wall for obstacle avoidance, enabling smooth navigation but lacks goal direction.
- **SBAD (State-Based Autonomous Driving)**: Implements a state machine approach to reduce noise sensitivity and improve stability.
- **OFSD (Open Field Selective Driving)** ‚úÖ: LiDAR-based avoidance algorithm that selects the best path based on detected open spaces.
