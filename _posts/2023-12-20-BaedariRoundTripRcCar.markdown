Baedari is a **low-cost RC car project** designed for round-trip autonomous driving, inspired by the **path integration** mechanism of desert ants. Developed from July to December 2023 as a graduation project, this system leverages **IR sensors** and a **2D LiDAR** to detect obstacles, plan routes, and return to its starting point.

## Abstract
Baedari aims to develop a **desert ant‚Äìinspired navigation system** for an RC car that can operate at low cost while performing obstacle detection and autonomous driving. By integrating **infrared (IR) sensors** of different frequencies for close-range safety and a **2D LiDAR** for mapping, the car is able to **drive to a target coordinate** and **return** to its origin. Throughout the project, a **stepwise experimental approach** was employed to tackle challenges in hardware, sensor fusion, and real-time path planning.

## Features

### 0. Incremental Implementation & Testing
Following the advice of our supervisor, we adopted a **stage-by-stage approach**:
1. **Basic hardware assembly + IR sensor tests** at low speed (safety & obstacle avoidance).  
2. **2D LiDAR integration** for obstacle detection.  
3. **Map creation & path planning** for more refined navigation.  
4. **Desert Ant‚Äìinspired path integration** for real-time location updates and efficient route planning (reducing computational overhead).


### **1. Incremental Implementation & Testing**
Following the advice of our supervisor, we adopted a **stage-by-stage approach**:
1. **Basic hardware assembly + IR sensor tests** at low speed (safety & obstacle avoidance).  
2. **2D LiDAR integration** for obstacle detection.  
3. **Map creation & path planning** for more refined navigation.  
4. **Desert Ant‚Äìinspired path integration** for real-time location updates and efficient route planning (reducing computational overhead).

### **2. Path Integration‚ÄìBased Position Estimation** 
Drawing on the **mechanisms of desert ants**, we designed an algorithm that updates the car‚Äôs current position based on motor signals (PWM).  
- **Straight-line movement** relies on a simple distance integration.  
- **Turning** leverages an Ackermann steering model to account for angular changes.  
- Accumulated error is mitigated by minimizing sharp turns and favoring straight paths whenever possible.

### **3. Obstacle Avoidance** 
Using **IR sensors** and a **2D LiDAR**, the car detects obstacles in its path. If an obstacle is too close or blocks the route, the system chooses an ‚Äúopen path‚Äù that best aligns with the original goal direction. The car‚Äôs width is also accounted for to ensure safe passage.

</p>

### **4. Position Update (Localization)** 
For **low-speed** operation, the car can fuse LiDAR measurements with a pre-mapped environment, improving position accuracy. At **higher speeds**, simpler dead reckoning (Path Integration) is used for speed efficiency.

For more details on the path integration and obstacle avoidance logic, see the code in  
[desert_ant_navigation_node.cpp](https://github.com/Poodlee/EEE4610_finals/blob/main/catkin_ws/src/desert_ant_navigation_node.cpp).

## Additional Commentary
This project demonstrates how **biological navigation** (desert ants) can be adapted into a robotic system for **affordable, rapid development**. By combining IR and 2D LiDAR data, the car can **avoid obstacles** and **reach specified coordinates** autonomously. While the **low-speed localization** achieves higher accuracy, the **high-speed mode** relies on simpler path integration to reduce computational overhead. Future improvements might include:
- More advanced SLAM algorithms for robust mapping  
- Integration with a higher-performance MCU or Jetson board  
- Enhanced obstacle detection using higher-resolution LiDARs
