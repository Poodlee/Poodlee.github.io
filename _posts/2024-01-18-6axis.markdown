Yonsei University's Roboin club is undertaking the RH+ project to design, build, and control a ~40 cm humanoid robot with environment perception. Following our initial 2-axis manipulator, we are now developing a **6-axis manipulator**, which is currently **in progress**. This advanced arm aims to tackle more complex tasks such as pick-and-place, stacking, and obstacle avoidance.

## Abstract
This project explores a 6-axis robotic arm for more sophisticated manipulation tasks, including pick-and-place, collision avoidance, and stacking. We leverage **MoveIt2** for 3D path planning and aim to integrate depth cameras for advanced spatial awareness. **Development is ongoing**, focusing on hardware assembly, motion control, and computer vision. <!--more-->

## Features

### 1. MoveIt2 Integration
We are incorporating **MoveIt2** to handle real-time path planning and collision detection in a 3D environment. This setup allows the arm to safely and accurately reach target positions even when obstacles are present.

### 2. FoundationPose-Based 6D Pose Estimation
For more robust vision capabilities, we plan to integrate **FoundationPose** (or a similar method) to estimate 6D poses of objects. This enables the manipulator to pick up and place items with higher precision by understanding each object's exact location and orientation.

## Additional Commentary
Developing a 6-axis arm involves a significantly more complex mechanical design and advanced kinematic configurations. By integrating ROS2 and MoveIt2, we aim to achieve **precise, real-time control**. Our future work will include improved object recognition, **6D pose estimation**, and refined grasping algorithms for diverse tasks. This project is evolving rapidly, and we will continue to share progress as new features are implemented.
